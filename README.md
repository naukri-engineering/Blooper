# Blooper
A library that enables Android and iOS applications to automatically post detailed crash reports to NewMonk.

We have been using [NewMonk](https://github.com/naukri-engineering/NewMonk) for Android and iOS Crash reporting. It helps us quickly identify and pin point crashes and diagnose them by device, app version and OS. Thus it helps fix issues before they reach end users and ship higher quality apps. It also keeps us informed about crashes through alerts so that we never miss a problem.
